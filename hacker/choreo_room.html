			Taking on my first real solo coding project
		</h3>
		<p>
			As part of my final project for CS193P, a Stanford course centered on iOS development, I created ChoreoRoom, an app that helps dance choreographers plan out the blocking (i.e., formations) for their pieces. I had come up with the idea along with a few other people at TreeHacks a year earlier, but at the time we weren't able to accomplish much due to our limited web development experience. This time, however, I was confident I would be able to turn our idea into a workable, usable product.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Note: after my friends and I created the idea of ChoreoRoom at TreeHacks in 2016, we learned of a similar app that already existed called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/playbook-dance/id572038933?mt=8" class="link-no-underline w3-text-strawberry-red">PlayBook</a>. While PlayBook already offered many of the features that we wanted out of ChoreoRoom, it had not been updated since 2013, meaning it still used pre-iOS 7 UI elements and was not optimized for newer devices. Thus, while I strived to make a better, more modern app by creating ChoreoRoom, I am grateful that PlayBook already existed because it served as a good baseline when developing my app.</i>

			Working on ChoreoRoom was hands-down my favorite coding project that I've ever worked on, which was mainly because of my personal interest in the project as an urban dance choreographer. Even when I felt completely lost or discovered particularly nasty bugs, I was always able to regain my momentum by reminding myself of how much the app meant to me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although I was able to use a lot of what I had learned in class that quarter, many of the app's features (such as the ability to share pieces via AirDrop and email) required researching new APIs and reading online tutorials. By the time I made my <a href="https://app.box.com/s/2fmnuuxighjiw460se5qr1i8prgy9aqz" class="link-no-underline w3-text-strawberry-red">final presentation</a> during finals week, I had developed a solid prototype for ChoreoRoom that I felt comfortable sharing with fellow choreographers for informal alpha testing. Going forward I would like to continue working on the app to make it even more polished: it's my goal to eventually put it on the App Store for choreographers everywhere to use.
