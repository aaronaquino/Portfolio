		In early 2017, as part of my final project for CS 193P, a Stanford course centered on iOS development, I created ChoreoRoom, an app that helps dance choreographers plan out the blocking (i.e., formations) for their pieces. I had come up with the idea along with a few other friends at <a href="https://www.treehacks.com/" target="_blank" class="colored-link">TreeHacks</a> a year earlier<sup>*</sup>, but at the time we weren't able to accomplish much due to our limited web development experience. This time, however, I was confident I would be able to turn our concept into a workable, usable product.

		Working on ChoreoRoom was hands-down my favorite coding project that I've ever worked on, which was mainly because of my personal interest as an urban dance choreographer. Even when I felt completely lost or discovered particularly nasty bugs, I was always able to regain my momentum by reminding myself of how much the app meant to me. Although I was able to use a lot of what I had learned in class, many of the app's features (such as the ability to share pieces via AirDrop and email) required researching new APIs, reading online tutorials, and browsing Stack Overflow. By the time I made my <a href="https://app.box.com/s/shdl0d1jg371ih310zazogi9wp4z5ub8" target="_blank" class="colored-link">final presentation</a> at the end of the quarter, I had developed a solid prototype for ChoreoRoom that I felt comfortable sharing with fellow choreographers for informal alpha testing.

		A few months later, over winter break my senior year, I found the time to polish the app for public release, which involved improving usability, fixing bugs, and overhauling the UI. Since January 2018, ChoreoRoom has been available as a free download on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/choreoroom/id1332273123" target="_blank" class="colored-link">App Store</a>! Its most recent update contained a handful of new features and enhancements, including color coding, multi-select mode, an updated gallery view, and higher resolution graphics when zooming. Knowing that my app is used and appreciated by real users whom I've never even met is a pretty rewarding feeling and motivates me to continue developing ChoreoRoom in the future.

		<sup>*</sup>After my friends and I created the idea of ChoreoRoom at TreeHacks, we learned of a similar app that already existed called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/playbook-dance/id572038933" target="_blank" class="colored-link">PlayBook</a>. While PlayBook already offered many of the features that we wanted out of ChoreoRoom, it had not been updated since 2013, meaning it still used pre-iOS 7 UI elements and was not optimized for newer devices. Thus, while I strived to make a better, more modern app by creating ChoreoRoom, I am grateful that PlayBook already existed because it served as a good baseline when developing my app.
