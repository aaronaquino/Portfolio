			36 hours of coding, tons of food, no sleep, and &hellip; New York?

			I know what you're thinking: it took him until sophomore year in college to finally attend a hackathon? Admittedly, going to a hackathon had been a goal of mine for a while, but all of the ones I heard about never seemed to fit my schedule. But that fall, a miracle occurred: I was accepted to the first ever <a href="http://hackingedu.co/" class="link-no-underline w3-text-strawberry-red">HackingEDU</a>, a hackathon dedicated to improving education through technology, and to my delight I discovered that the event did not conflict with anything on my schedule. You should've seen the look of joy on my face as I clicked the RSVP button to confirm my attendance. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My first task involved finding a team to work with. I ended up forming a team with my younger brother, Trevor and his two friends, Jessica and Clarence. All three of them are still in high school, yet both Trevor and Jessica had previously attended hackathons, which made me feel confident having them on my team. Going into the event the four of us already knew that our priority wasn't to win any prizes but rather to expand our coding repertoires by experimenting with new technologies.

			In the hours leading up to the start of HackingEDU, we decided that we would try and build an iPhone app (as well as a companion website) called ReTask. ReTask was meant to be a To-Do list for high school students that would allow them to easily sort tasks by priority as well as academic subject. In addition, one of the highlights of ReTask was to make it easy for users to reach out to their teachers (via email) as well as their peers (through Facebook groups) directly from the app.
		</p>
		<p>
			My job on the team was to work primarily on coding the app using Swift and Apple's Xcode IDE. I had never created an iOS app before, and I discovered that there was a pretty steep learning curve. As I worked through a beginner tutorial on the Apple Developer website, I found that I was generally able to understand the code I was writing (given my familiarity with other languages such as Java, C++, and JavaScript). The drawback to using the tutorial, however, was that most of the syntax and iOS-specific conventions didn't stick in my mind. On top of this I struggled with certain mobile app concepts, such as having delegates for UI elements or connecting View Controllers. In the future, if I actually wanted to get a solid foundation in iOS programming, then I would probably want to take an actual iPhone app development course.

			By the end of the hackthon, although I technically had a working app, it was nowhere near having the functionality that our team had initially envisioned, so we decided not to submit it for judging. Trevor and Jessica did manage to set up a pretty awesome landing page for ReTask, which I thought was pretty cool. My experience at HackingEDU taught me two main lessons that I will definitely carry forward with me in my coding career. First, set aside more time than you think when you're going to be working with a new technology. Second, when coming up with a project idea, try and make your idea as simple as possible so that you can actually achieve a working version (you can always add on more features later). That being said, I had a great time at HackingEDU. It's not very often, especially at a place like Stanford, that you can take 36 hours to dive into something new knowing that you might completely fail. On another note: connecting to the Wi-Fi tricked our computers into thinking we were in New York City, so we were able to troll our friends a little bit on social media (see below).
