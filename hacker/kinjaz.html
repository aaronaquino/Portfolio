			Combining my love of CS with my love of dance

		<p>
			While working as a TA for the <a href="../connector/rc.html" class="link-no-underline w3-text-strawberry-red">Computer Simulations and Interactive Media</a> course for Stanford Pre-Collegiates Summer Institutes this past summer, I spent a lot of time helping kids with HTML and CSS. Most of this time was spent on the basics of these two languages, which made me feel pretty comfortable since I did not have much of a web development background. After the course ended and I returned home, I decided that I wanted to play around with these technologies even more, which ultimately led to the decision to try and build a small <a href="https://aaronaquino.github.io/Kinjaz" class="link-no-underline w3-text-strawberry-red">website</a>.

			Around the time, one of my favorite urban dance crews, the <a href="https://www.kinjaz.com" class="link-no-underline w3-text-strawberry-red">Kinjaz</a>, had just launched a website of their own to keep fans updated with announcements, dance videos, and merchandise. As a result, I decided I would a Kinjaz website of my own by modeling some aspects of their site while adding some new features of my own. Over the next couple of days, I slowly built up my site, starting with a few simple pages and then adding images, tables, a navigation bar, and even dynamically generated footers. Google was definitely my friend as it connected me to a lot of helpful resources as I played around with HTML and CSS. I found the tutorials from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" class="link-no-underline w3-text-strawberry-red">W3Schools</a> to be especially useful because of their simple instructions and wide topic coverage.

			Overall I enjoyed the experience of learning the basics of web development at my own pace. Rather than have to learn about specific topics and conventions as I would in a class, I was able to focus on the areas that I was actually interested in. I had never taught myself a programming skill before, and my experience building the Kinjaz site taught me to be self-reliant when it came to figuring out bugs in my code. Thus, I would definitely say that working on my own made me a more confident programmer in general. Moving forward, my next goal is to try and build my own personal website from scratch in order to host my digital portfolio.
