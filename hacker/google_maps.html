		I didn't quite know what to expect as I began my internship at Google's headquarters in Mountain View. It would be my first real experience at a tech company, and on top of that I was nervous about how my previous coding experience (which was primarily through courses at school) would translate over to real-world work. Perhaps my biggest concern was getting up to speed on the vast array of new technologies and sections of the codebase that I would be working with while not slowing down my coworkers with too many questions.
	</p>
	<p>
		My fears were quickly forgotten as I began work with my team, which was composed of just three other employees and me. All of our work stations (which were adjustable stand-up desks, bless up) were located close together in our corner of the office, so Chi, my host, was usually no more than six feet away whenever I needed help. Chi's cheerfulness and constant willingness to assist me whenever I was stuck (and believe me, those first few days were particularly challenging) contributed to my never being afraid of asking for help, which substantially eased my transition into the Google work environment.

		My two projects for the summer were tied to our team's overall goal, which was to help make the desktop version of <a href="https://maps.google.com" target="_blank" class="colored-link">Google Maps</a> run more smoothly. My first project involved making improvements to the application's searchbox that allowed users to submit queries more quickly. The project gave me real-world experience with creating new classes, translating my ideas into design docs, writing thorough unit and integration tests, and measuring the user impact of my features. It was a pretty incredible feeling the first time I saw the real-time stats on how my changes were benefitting users all over the world.

	<p>
		In addition, I worked on a second project that involved designing better logging metrics and a user experiment to better understand first user actions. My design process looked something like this: I would send my demos over to my manager, receive his feedback, implement the necessary changes, and then repeat. This cycle gave me a preview of what it's like working as a UI/UX developer and allowed me to experiment with Google's <a href="https://material.google.com/" target="_blank" class="colored-link">Material Design</a>. I also had the chance to meet with our product manager and have some insightful conversations over the pros and cons of different design options.

		One of my favorite aspects of our team was that we were able to discuss and bond over topics outside of our work. We would get lunch together on most days, and I loved the variety in our meal conversations, which ranged from the latest <i>Game of Thrones</i> episodes to personal relationships to generational differences between us and our parents. And unlike most other interns, I spent time traveling with my team: during the summer we visited other Google offices in Seattle and San Francisco. Not only did these excursions give me a glimpse into the life of other work locations, but they also provided plenty of opportunities to bond with my team, whether that was visiting the iconic <a href="https://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/" target="_blank" class="colored-link">Chihuly Garden and Glass</a> or grabbing ice cream from the legendary <a href="http://www.humphryslocombe.com/" target="_blank" class="colored-link">Humphry Slocombe</a>. All of these interactions were fun contributions to our work-life balance and ultimately helped us perform better as a team when we returned to work.
