			I love design projects that give me the chance to reflect on years of past experiences, and this piece was no exception (for other examples, check out my the work in the <a href="./digital_art.html" class="colored-link">Digital Art</a> section). You can trace the origins of this work back to a few years ago, when I decided that it would be a good idea to start a dance journal to keep track of my progress as both a student and teacher of urban dance. The journal itself isn't very elaborate (it's actually a Google Sheet, since I do almost everything in the cloud these days), but it does the job of keeping track of every class I've taken, workshop I've led, and performance I've been a part of in addition to personal and technical lessons learned with each experience. Since this past summer I had been toying with the idea of creating some sort of visual representation of this unique and personal dataset as a way to commemorate and reflect on my journey so far.

		<p>
			While I initially tried mapping the data to a linear timeline (the <a href="./assets/dance_timeline.png" target="_blank" class="colored-link">result</a> was actually pretty neat and reminded me of an upside down tree), I ultimately settled on the design you see above. The overall layout was inspired by this super cool <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nycsubway/the-new-york-city-subway-468-stations-1-poster" target="_blank" class="colored-link">NYC Subway poster</a> I saw last summer, and the individual blocks were loosely based on the new Material Design chips you now see in Google products. A number of details in this design make me extremely happy, such as the rounded corners in the blocks, which imply a sort of softness, or how the different shades of blue play off one another. Getting the left and right edges of all the blocks to align was also challenging, but seeing the final effect makes all of the painstaking, detailed work worth it.

			But definitely the best part of creating this work was getting to reflect on the tremendous volume of experiences that have helped get me to this point in my dance journey. I'm lucky to have videos from a large number of these, and going through them was a wholesome time as it caused me to think about music, choreography, and even fellow dancers (some of whom I haven't seen in a long time) from my past. Reflecting on the process is such a huge part of my life journey, and I plan on continuing the practice into the future of my dance journey and beyond.
