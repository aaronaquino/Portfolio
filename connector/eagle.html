			My journey from Tiger Cub to Eagle Scout
		</h3>
		<p>
			When I first joined Cub Scouts in kindergarten, I never imagined where my path in Scouting would lead me. Back then I was mainly interested in building Pinewood derby cars and earning belt loops. But as I grew older and transitioned into Boy Scouts, I gradually adopted leadership roles, such as Troop Historian and Campmaster. As I progressed through the various ranks, I felt empowered by my growing sense of self-confidence and responsibility to the troop. It was not long before I set my sights on the rank of Eagle, Scouting's highest award. This final challenge would require me to apply all the skills that I had acquired throughout my twelve years of Scouting.

			For my <a href="https://app.box.com/s/k4ja5o4cztz3gvo9iuh6" class="link-no-underline w3-text-strawberry-red">Eagle Project</a>, I organized the construction of fifty emergency door reinforcements for a Title I elementary school. In the event of a campus lockdown, these reinforcements would prevent classroom doors from opening, even if the doors were inadvertently unlocked. It is somewhat poignant that I officially earned my Eagle two days before the tragic incident at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut.

			I spent the first five months of my year-long project testing and perfecting prototypes. I soon realized that designing a reinforcement while carefully considering security, cost, and ease of use would not be easy. The process was challenging and at times pushed my patience to the limit. Persistence was also necessary when I approached a local, independent lumber yard for a donation. Despite their initial reluctance, I knew that the company would contribute once they fully understood my project's significance. Talking with the manager, I felt a mixture of optimism and apprehension. Nevertheless, after explaining how the reinforcements would considerably increase school children's safety, I secured the donation of all the wood.

			Upon completing my project's final phase, which included giving an instructional presentation to the entire elementary school staff about their new reinforcements, I was surprised by the level of gratitude the teachers and administrators expressed. It was then that I fully realized the significance of my accomplishment. Earning Eagle marked the end of the journey I began as a Tiger Cub all those years ago. Along the way I grew from a reserved and passive Scout into a strong and effective leader. Above all, I proved to the outside world and to myself that I am capable of bringing people together to make meaningful contributions to my community.
