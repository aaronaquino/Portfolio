			I spent the summer after my freshman year at Stanford working as a Residential Counselor (RC) for a high school enrichment program called the <a href="https://summerinstitutes.spcs.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" class="colored-link">Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes</a>. I was assigned to help with the Computer Simulations and Interactive Media course, which focused on teaching students the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills needed to design and build their own video games. All of the students in my course lived together with a few other RCs in a Stanford co-op called the <a href="https://resed.stanford.edu/residences/find-house/enchanted-broccoli-forest" target="_blank" class="colored-link">Enchanted Broccoli Forest</a>.

			My primary responsibility as a RA was serving as a teaching assistant for the Computer Simulations course. This entailed leading daily afternoon study sessions during which the students practiced working with new material. One of the biggest challenges of leading these TA sessions was adjusting the material to meet the needs of all of the students, who came in with a wide range of computer science (CS) backgrounds. Some had never written a single line of code while a few had already created their own game libraries. Consequently we would sometimes split up the class into smaller groups so that people with similar skill levels could work closely with one of the RAs. During these times I would often ask to work with the students who were new to CS.

			Without a doubt one of my favorite parts of being an RA was introducing CS to students who had never experienced it before and watching them grow as programmers. As I explained basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, and functions, it made me remember what it was like when I first learned to code. These fond early memories I had of learning CS motivated me to work even harder to create a positive learning environment for my participants. The experience of working closely with such bright, creative students reinforced for me how much I love helping others learn. On top of all this, my summer at EBF allowed me to meet all sorts of cool people and make a ton of new friends, many of whom I still keep in touch with.
