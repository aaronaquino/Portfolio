			Keeping the funds flowing for PASU

		<p>
			As a fourth-generation American who is half-Filipino and half-Chinese, I spent a greater part of my childhood not really knowing about either of my parents' two cultures. I was familiar with a few cultural traditions from my Chinese side of the family, such as celebrating Chinese New Year, but as for my Filipino side, I really didn't have much to go on. This desire to learn more about myself pushed me to join the Pilipino American Student Union, or PASU, when I came to Stanford. Besides exposing me to Filipino culture, history, and social issues, PASU has allowed me to connect with a fun, positive group of people who all share a strong sense of <i>pamilya</i>.

			After serving as a frosh intern for PASU's Social Committee my freshman year, this past year I decided to take a larger role within the group as one of two Co-Chairs for the Treasury Committee. PASU is composed of nine different committees, each of which organizes a variety of events throughout the year. Treasury is a little different from the other eight committees since we didn't put on our own events; instead we helped committees secure the funding they needed to make their events a success. We obtained this financial support in two ways: my fellow Co-Chair, Nahri, worked hard to help us get funding from ASSU whereas I was in charge of getting funding from The Stanford Fund (TSF).

			Essentially, TSF does a lot of the hard work of reaching out to Stanford alumni and other donors and asking them to support undergraduate education. In return for TSF providing our group with funding, every quarter our members write thank-you cards to donors. I acted as the link between TSF and PASU: I made sure that all of our letters and postcards were completed thoroughly and in a timely manner. The toughest part of my job was making sure PASU members followed through with the letters that were assigned to them. This often involved maintaining organized spreadsheets, writing motivational emails laden with GIFs, and following up with individual members. Nevertheless, I loved serving as a Treasury Co-Chair. It was a nice feeling knowing that my work helped support PASU's other committees, and playing an active role on PASU's core meant that I was able to bond even more closely with the other students in our group.
