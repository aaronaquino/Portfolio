			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lgcy_dance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="colored-link">Legacy</a> is Stanford's only competitive choreography dance team and was founded in 2016. Although I was invited to be a part of the team's original roster, I declined in order to focus on my leadership roles for <a href="/dancer/common_origins.html" class="colored-link">Common Origins</a>. It was a tough decision, but I made myself a promise: I would use my year on CO to focus on building community and helping others grow (in the same way other choreographers did for me when I first joined the team), and the following year I would prioritize my own growth and go out for Legacy. Fast foward to my senior year, and that's exactly what I did. Dancing with Legacy was one of the highlights of my final year as an undergrad, and my positive experience with the team was heavily influenced by three factors.

			First, Legacy provided me with an amazing community of people who are not just fellow performers but also friends. This is evident in the myriad of social events the team organizes, which range from freestyle cyphers and movie nights to kickbacks and late-night food funs. Legacy's openness also helps it stand out in the Stanford Dance Community: we're open to people of all genders, and we're the only audition team on campus that accepts community members. Thus, friendships on the team connect those with different academic interests and dance backgrounds as well as people who are at different stages in life. Each quarter we have about 15–25 members, and this small team size leads to an improved team dynamic that is hard to find on other Stanford teams.

			The second reason Legacy stands out is because of its commitment to growth. The team was founded upon a philosophy of humility and improvement, and it's no coincidence that all three founders came from Common Origins, Stanford's only non-audition team. Legacy's members actively want to get better, and one of the ways the team enforces this mentality is by having members reaudition every quarter. Although this might seem more stressful in comparison with the other Stanford audition teams, whose members need to only pass an audition once in order to join the team for life, reauditioning is beneficial in the long run because it eliminates complacency. Since all members go through the same audition process together, everyone feels like they have an equal stake in the team that quarter, whether it's their first or fifth quarter with Legacy. The team also sets aside time each quarter to focus on training, which includes physical conditioning, learning from outside teachers, and drilling dance fundamentals.

			Perhaps the biggest reason why I decided to join Legacy was to be able to compete. As I mentioned before, Legacy is Stanford's only competitive choreography dance team, which is not to be confused with an audition team, whose members go through a try-out process to join. Rather, Legacy is competitive because it travels off-campus to compete against other collegiate and community teams at events such as <a href="https://www.worldofdance.com/watch/videos/legacy-wodla17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="colored-link">World of Dance</a>, Breakthrough, and <a href="https://youtu.be/QskqQMetUtk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="colored-link">Evolution</a>. These competitions push our team creatively, which you can see in not just our choreography and formations but also in our themed sets. Basically, as opposed to building performances of four or five random pieces that are linked together, recently Legacy has focused on building sets that tell a story or have some sort of unifying message. For example, our performances from the 2017–18 season focused on <a href="https://youtu.be/dGqQ0_Q_LdQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="colored-link">office workers</a> struggling to escape from their everyday lives, <a href="https://youtu.be/FBR9G-KPYzo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="colored-link">Nintendo Wii</a> characters battling for glory and a <a href="https://youtu.be/Sfppm-HPfk0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="colored-link">one-song set</a> featuring &ldquo;Bank Account&rdquo; by 21 Savage. In my experience, these sorts of sets not only tend to do better at competitions but are usually more fun to construct as well as more enjoyable for the audience.
